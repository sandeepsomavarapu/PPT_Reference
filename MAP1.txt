MAP is not child interface of Collection. 

If we want to represent a group of objects as key,value pairs then we should go for Map.

Key	value

101	raju     ---  entry

102	kishore  

103	sumit

Both keys and values are objects only ,duplicate keys are not allowed but values can be duplicated

Each key-value pair is called Entry,hence map is consider as a collection of entry objects

MAP interface methods:
----------------------

1)Object  put(Object key,Object value)

to add one key value pair to the map, if the key is already present then old value will replaced with new value and returns old value

ex: m.put(101,"durga")   o/p durga replaced with ravi
    m.put(102,"shiva")
    m.put(101,"ravi")

2)void putAll(map m); --Add a group of key values pairs added


3)Object get(Object key) - Returns the value associated with specified key

4)Object remove(Object key) -Removes the entry associated with specified key

5)boolean containKey(object key)

6)boolean containValue(Object value)

7)boolean isEmpty();

8)int size();

9) void clear();

Collection views of Map:
------------------------

Set KeySet()

Set entrySet()

Collection values()

Entry Interface:
----------------

A MAP is a group of key value pairs and each pkey value pair is called an ENTRY.

Hence Map is consider as A collection of entry objects

with out existing map object their is no chance of existing entry object hence entry interface is defined inside map interface 


interface Map{

interface Entry{

Object getKey();   --Entry specific methods and we can apply
Object getValue();    only on entry object
Object setValue(Object o)

}

}



HASHMAP:
--------

->The underlaying datastructure is Hashtable
-> Insertion order is not preservedand it is based on hashcode of key

-->duplicate keys are not allowed but values can be duplicated

-->Heterogeneous objects are allowed both key and value

-->null is allowed for key (only once)

-->null is allowed for values(any no.of times)

-->HashMap implements serializable,cloneable interfaces but not random access

-->HashMap is best choice if our frequent operation is search operation

constructors:
-------------

1)HashMap m = new HashMap()

creates an empty hash map object with default intial capacity 16 and default fill ration 0.75

2) HashMap m = new HashMap(initalcapacity ic);

creates an empty hash map object with specified initial capacity and default fill ratio 0.75

3) HashMap m = new HashMap(int initalcapacity ic,float fillration);

2) HashMap m = new HashMap(HashMap m);



Differeces between HashMap and Hashtable:
-----------------------------------------

1) NOT SYNCHORNIZED  1) NOT SYNCHORNIZED

2) NOT THREAD SAFE  2) ONLY ONE THREAD IS THREADSAFE

3)RELATIVE PERFORMACE IS HIGH 3) PERFORMANCE IS LOW

4)NULL IS ALLOWD FOR KEY ,VALUES 4) NOT APPLICABLE

5) NOT LEGACY 1.2V 5) LEGACY 1.0V



HOW TO GET SYNCHRONIZED VERSION OF HASHMAP OBJECT:
----------------------------------------------------

HashMap m = new HashMap();

Map m1 = Collections.synchronizedMap(m);


by default HashMap is non-synchronized but we can get synchronized version of HashMap by using synchronizedMap method of Collections class





Hashtable:
==========
1)underlying datastructure is hastable.
2)insertion order is preserved based hashcode of keys.
3)duplicate keys are not allowed but values can be duplicate.
4)Heterogeneous objects allowed as key and value.
5)null is not allowed for both key and value (NullPointerException)
6)every method present in hashtable is thread safe because of  all methods are synchronized.
7)default 


**for hashmap and hashset default size is 16

**for  hashtable default size is 11  fil ratio is 0.75.

HashMap<Integer,String> hm=new HashMap<Integer,String>();

Properties p=new Properties();//<String,String>



Properties:
===========
Properties p=new Properties()
//here both key and value should be String type.

Methods:
========
//to get property value by using the property name

p.getProperty(String pname)// return String

//to  store some value using  properties object.

p.setProperty(String pname,String pval);

//if we want load properties  file properties to our java file then we  need to use method load 

p.load()

//after loading if we want reflect the values in properties file what are the changes we made in java.

p.store()
