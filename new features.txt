Java is a platform independent programming language which is introduced by James Gosling and his team mates in the year 1991.

First they want to develop programming language for the Setup boxes and small embedded systems in the year of 1991.they named it as “Green talk”, because the file extension is ‘.gt’. After that they renamed as “Oak”, it’s a tree name. But they faced some trademark issues in 1995 they renamed it as “Java”
