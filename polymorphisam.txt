polymorphisam:
==============
one thing in different ways.
one task in diff ways.
poly means many.
morphisam means forms.

Ex:one person have different behaviours.

polymorphisam's two types

1)compile time polumorphisam // static binding //  early binding.

**we can achieve compile time polumorphisam using overloading concept it may be method or constructor.
	1)method overloading.//method name is signature is different
	2)constructor overloading.// ''     ''   ''   ''
	3)operater overloading.//one operater with more than one behaviour ex:   '+' operater
example for compile time polumorphisam method overloading because it binds mapping's at compile time.
2)runtime polymorphisam // dynamic binding // lazy binding

**we can achieve run time polymorphisam using overriding.



OVERRIDING:
===========

**8 rules for over riding

1)while overriding the parent class method signature and child cllass method signature should be same.

2)while overriding overriided method and overridden method must be same.****@ premitive level must be same @ class  level may be different.

3)@class level we can change the return type  of overriding metthod.
