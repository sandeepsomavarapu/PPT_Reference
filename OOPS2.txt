
**is-a (or)inheritance:-
============
*if we want total functionality of class automatically then we should go for is-a relationship.

*if we want part of the functionality then we should go for has-a relationship.


Method Signature:-
=================
*in java method signature consists of method names followed by argument types 
ex:-public static int m1(int i, float f)

in this m1(int i, float f) method signature
 * return type is not part of method signature in java.
*compiler will use method signature to resolve  method calls.
ex:-
class test
{
public void m1(int i)
{

}
public void m2(string s)
{

}
}
test t=new test();
t.m1(10);
t.m2("sas");
t.m3(10.5);{CE:can't find symbol symbol:method m3(double) location:class test}

*with in a class two methods with a same signature not allowed 
ex:-
class test
{
{
public void m1(int i)
}
public int m1(int x)
{
return 10;
}
}
CE :-m1(int) is already defined in test

 OVER LOADING:-
=================
*TWO METHODS ARE SAID TO BE OVERLAODED if and only if both methods having same name but different arguments types.
*in c language method overloading concept is not available hence we can't declare multiple methods with same name but different  arguments types ,if there is change in argument type compalsary we should go for new method name which increases complexity of programing.

IN C -LANG:-
--------------------
abs(int i)=>abs(10);
labs(long l)=>labs(10 L);
fabs(float f)=>fabs(10.5f);

* but in java we can declare multiple methods with same name but different argument types such type methods are called over loaded methods
IN JAVA:-
---------------
abs(int i)
abs(long L)
abs(float f)
*having overlading concept in java reduces complexity of programming 
Ex:-
class test
{
public void m1()
{
sopln("no arg");
}
public void m1(int i)
{
sopln("int org");
}
public void m1(double d)
{
sopln("double-org");
}
psvm(string[] args)
{
test a=new test();
t.m1();no-org
t.m2(10);int-org
t.m3(10.5);double-org
}
}
here 3 methods are over loaded methods

**in overloading method resolution always takes care by compiler based on reference type hence overloading is also considered as compile time polymorphisam or static polymorphisam or early binding .
